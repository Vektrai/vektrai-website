# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for updating VEKTRAI's website content to broaden the target audience from students-only to a more professional, inclusive positioning. The update will involve modifying HTML content and JavaScript translation files across all pages while maintaining the existing website structure, styling, and functionality. The goal is to make minimal, targeted changes that transform the messaging without requiring a complete redesign.

## Architecture

### Content Update Strategy

The website uses a multilingual architecture with:
1. **HTML files** containing English content with `data-lang-key` attributes
2. **JavaScript translation object** (`assets/js/script.js`) containing translations for English, Arabic, and French
3. **Meta tags** in HTML `<head>` sections for SEO and social media

The update strategy will:
- Modify hardcoded English text in HTML files
- Update translation keys in the JavaScript translations object for all three languages
- Update meta tags (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter Card) across all pages
- Maintain consistency across all language versions

### Affected Files

**HTML Files:**
- `index.html` - Homepage with hero, features, projects, testimonials
- `about.html` - Company information and team
- `services.html` - Service offerings and pricing
- `portfolio.html` - Project showcase
- `contact.html` - Contact form and information
- `faq.html` - Frequently asked questions (if contains student-specific content)

**JavaScript Files:**
- `assets/js/script.js` - Contains the `translations` object with all multilingual content

## Error Handling

### Validation Strategy

1. **Content Consistency Check:**
   - Verify all instances of "student" or "academic" language are updated
   - Ensure consistency across all three language versions
   - Check that no orphaned student-specific references remain

2. **Translation Completeness:**
   - Verify all translation keys are updated in English, Arabic, and French
   - Ensure translations maintain equivalent meaning across languages
   - Test language switcher functionality after updates

3. **Meta Tag Validation:**
   - Verify all meta tags are properly formatted
   - Check Open Graph and Twitter Card previews
   - Validate HTML structure remains intact

4. **Link Integrity:**
   - Ensure no broken links after updates
   - Verify all `data-lang-key` attributes still reference valid translation keys

### Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:
1. Keep backup copies of original files
2. Use version control (Git) to track changes
3. Test changes on a staging environment before production deployment

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Visual Inspection:**
   - Review all pages in browser
   - Check each language version (EN, AR, FR)
   - Verify text displays correctly without layout issues

2. **Content Verification:**
   - Confirm all student-specific language is removed
   - Verify professional tone is consistent
   - Check testimonial roles are appropriately updated

3. **Functional Testing:**
   - Test language switcher functionality
   - Verify all links work correctly
   - Check responsive design on mobile devices

4. **SEO Testing:**
   - Verify meta tags in browser dev tools
   - Check Open Graph preview using Facebook Debugger
   - Check Twitter Card preview using Twitter Card Validator

### Automated Testing

1. **HTML Validation:**
   - Run HTML files through W3C Validator
   - Check for any syntax errors introduced

2. **Search for Remaining References:**
   - Use grep/search to find any remaining instances of "student" (case-insensitive)
   - Search for "academic" in contexts that should be changed
   - Search for "university standards" references

3. **Translation Key Validation:**
   - Verify all `data-lang-key` attributes reference existing translation keys
   - Check JavaScript syntax is valid after updates

### Test Cases

## Design Decisions and Rationales

### Decision 1: Minimal Structural Changes

**Rationale:** The existing website structure is sound. Making only content changes reduces risk of introducing bugs and maintains the current user experience.

### Decision 2: Maintain University Affiliations in Testimonials

**Rationale:** Keeping university names maintains credibility and authenticity of testimonials while removing the "Student" designation makes them more timeless and professional.

### Decision 3: Keep Regional Focus

**Rationale:** The Middle East focus is a key differentiator and should be maintained. The update broadens the audience type (students to all clients) but keeps the geographic focus.

### Decision 4: Update All Three Languages Simultaneously

**Rationale:** Ensures consistency across all language versions and prevents confusion for multilingual users. All languages should reflect the same professional positioning.

### Decision 5: Preserve Existing Translation Keys

**Rationale:** Keeping the same translation key names (e.g., `hero-title`) maintains code consistency and reduces the risk of breaking the language switcher functionality.

## Accessibility Considerations

1. **Semantic HTML:** Maintain existing semantic structure
2. **ARIA Labels:** Verify no ARIA labels reference student-specific content
3. **Alt Text:** Check image alt text for student-specific language
4. **Language Attributes:** Ensure `lang` attributes remain correct for each language version

## SEO Considerations

1. **Keyword Strategy:** Shift from "student AI consulting" to "professional AI consulting" and "AI engineering solutions"
2. **Meta Descriptions:** Update to target broader audience while maintaining regional focus
3. **Content Quality:** Maintain high-quality, relevant content that serves the new target audience
4. **URL Structure:** No changes needed - existing URLs remain valid

## Browser Compatibility

No changes to browser compatibility requirements. The updates are content-only and will work in all browsers that currently support the website.

## Performance Impact

Minimal to no performance impact. Content changes do not affect:
- Page load times
- JavaScript execution
- CSS rendering
- Image loading
- Network requests

## Localization Notes

### Arabic Translation Guidelines

- Use formal, professional Arabic terminology
- Maintain consistency with existing Arabic style
- Ensure right-to-left (RTL) layout remains functional
- Use appropriate professional equivalents for "client" (عميل) instead of "student" (طالب)

### French Translation Guidelines

- Use formal French appropriate for professional services
- Maintain consistency with existing French style
- Use "client" instead of "étudiant"
- Ensure professional tone matches English version

## Future Considerations

1. **Content Strategy:** Consider adding case studies for non-student clients as they are acquired
2. **Testimonials:** Plan to add testimonials from professional clients in the future
3. **Service Descriptions:** May need to expand service descriptions to explicitly mention corporate/professional services
4. **Portfolio:** Consider categorizing projects by type (academic vs. professional) in the future
