## Technical Implementation

### Translation System
The website uses a JavaScript-based translation system with the following features:

1. **Translation Object Structure**:
   ```javascript
   const translations = {
     en: { /* English translations */ },
     ar: { /* Arabic translations */ },
     fr: { /* French translations */ }
   };
   ```

2. **Language Switching Function**:
   - `updateLanguage(lang)`: Updates all elements with data-lang-key attributes
   - Automatically sets HTML direction (LTR/RTL) based on language
   - Saves language preference to localStorage
   - Updates active language button styling

3. **RTL Support**:
   - CSS attribute selector `[dir="rtl"]` for Arabic-specific styles
   - Proper text alignment and direction
   - Mirrored layouts for navigation, forms, and content
   - Icon positioning adjustments for RTL

### Translation Coverage

All pages have complete translations:
- ✅ Navigation (6 items)
- ✅ Home Page (Hero, Features, Projects, Testimonials, CTA)
- ✅ About Page (Intro, Team, Mission/Vision, Timeline)
- ✅ Services Page (4 services, 3 pricing tiers)
- ✅ Portfolio Page (8 projects)
- ✅ Contact Page (Form, Contact methods)

   - Navigate to another page
   - Verify language preference is maintained

4. **Form Placeholders**:
