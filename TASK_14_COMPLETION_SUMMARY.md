   - Option B: Replace with actual professional photos and project screenshots

2. **Optimize Images**:
   - Compress all images using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
   - Ensure images meet size requirements specified in README.md
   - Consider WebP format for better compression

3. **Test Image Loading**:
   - Verify all images load correctly on all pages
