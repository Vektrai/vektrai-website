## Critical Issues

### ðŸ”´ ISSUE-001: Language Buttons Enlarge on Mobile
**Severity:** Critical
**Component:** Language Switcher
**Pages Affected:** All pages
**Breakpoints Affected:** 375px, 414px, 480px
**Browser:** All browsers
**Date Found:** [To be filled during testing]

**Description:**
Language buttons (EN, AR, FR) are getting bigger when shrinking the screen, particularly at the top of the page. This is a responsive design flaw where buttons should maintain consistent size or get smaller on mobile devices, not larger.

**Expected Behavior:**
Language buttons should maintain consistent size or reduce in size as viewport width decreases to mobile breakpoints.

**Actual Behavior:**
Language buttons increase in size when viewport shrinks to mobile widths.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open any page at desktop width (1366px)
2. Measure language button dimensions (font-size, padding, total size)
3. Gradually resize viewport to 768px, 414px, 375px
4. Observe buttons getting larger instead of smaller

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience on mobile devices
- Potential navigation overflow
- Inconsistent with responsive design principles
- May affect button accessibility and usability

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Inspect CSS media queries affecting language buttons
2. Add or modify media queries to reduce button size on mobile
3. Ensure font-size, padding, and dimensions scale down appropriately
4. Test at all breakpoints to verify consistent sizing

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Open
**Assigned To:** [To be assigned]
**Priority:** P0 (Must fix before validation complete)
