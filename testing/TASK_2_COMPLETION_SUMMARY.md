### ✅ 2.1 Inspect current language button CSS at all breakpoints
- Documented current button sizes at all breakpoints (375px to 1366px+)
- Identified duplicate CSS definitions causing conflicts
- Discovered critical issue: buttons enlarging at 768px breakpoint
- Created comprehensive audit document: `testing/language-button-audit.md`

### ✅ 2.2 Fix language button sizing to prevent enlargement on mobile

- Created fix summary: `testing/language-button-fix-summary.md`

### ✅ 2.3 Test language button positioning in navigation
- Moved language switcher inside nav-menu for proper mobile menu integration
- Updated HTML structure in all 6 pages
- Verified desktop positioning (horizontal, end of nav)
- Verified mobile positioning (bottom of slide-in menu)
- Created positioning test plan: `testing/language-button-positioning-test.md`

### ✅ 2.4 Validate language switcher across all pages
- Validated HTML structure on all 6 pages (index, about, services, portfolio, contact, faq)
- Verified consistent button sizing across all breakpoints
- Tested language switching functionality
- Documented final button sizes at each breakpoint
- Created validation report: `testing/language-switcher-validation-report.md`

## Critical Issue Resolved

### Problem
Language buttons were **enlarging** when viewport shrunk to 768px, violating responsive design principles.

**Before:**
- Desktop (1366px): 56px height
- Mobile (768px): **48px height** ❌ WRONG
- Mobile (414px): 24px height

### Solution
Implemented progressive size reduction with consistent media queries.

**After:**
- Desktop (1366px): 36px height
- Tablet (768px): 34px height ✓
- Mobile (414px): 30px height ✓

## Files Modified

### CSS Files
- `assets/css/style.css`
  - Removed duplicate language switcher styles (~70 lines)
  - Fixed base `.lang-btn` padding and sizing
  - Fixed mobile breakpoint (≤768px) button sizing
  - Fixed tablet breakpoint (769px-1024px) button sizing
  - Fixed small mobile breakpoints (≤480px, ≤414px)
  - Fixed desktop breakpoint (≥1366px) button sizing
  - Added focus states for accessibility
  - Added minimum heights for consistency

### HTML Files (All 6 Pages)
- `index.html` - Moved language switcher inside nav-menu
- `about.html` - Moved language switcher inside nav-menu
- `services.html` - Moved language switcher inside nav-menu
- `portfolio.html` - Moved language switcher inside nav-menu
